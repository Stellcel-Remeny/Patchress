CREGFIX
=======

CREGFIX is a small DOS driver that works around an issue of many modern CSM
BIOS implementations where certain control register bits are left "dirty", thus
causing issues when trying to run legacy operating systems such as Microsoft
Windows 9x (see "While initializing device VCACHE: Windows protection error"
issue) or while trying to run EMM386.EXE.

This program can be built using "nasm":

  nasm cregfix.asm -fbin -o cregfix.sys

but included in this repository is the prebuilt "cregfix.sys" file.

CREGFIX is a DOS-compatible .SYS driver which can be added to the beginning of
the CONFIG.SYS file and it will sanitise the control register bits every time
DOS boots up. For example:

  DEVICE=C:\CREGFIX.SYS
