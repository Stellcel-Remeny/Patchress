vbesvga.drv and vddvbe.386

Modern Generic SVGA driver for Windows 3.1

This is a rewrite of the Windows 3.1 SVGA driver, designed to support
ALL available 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit or 32-bit graphic modes on any
system providing the VESA BIOS Extensions (hence the VBE in the name).
It is based on the Video 7 SVGA driver included in the Win16 Driver
Development Kit, with most of the hardware-specific code gutted out, and
with support added for multi-byte pixels.

Why on Earth did I make such a thing?

- To demonstrate that it's possible to run Windows 3.1 in True-Colour
  Full HD
- Because my AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT doesn't support 256-colour modes,
  rendering the old VESA Patch useless for me
- To help out any fellow enthusiasts who like running old software on
  new hardware!

Screenshots

Using standard Program Manager shell

[True-Colour Full HD screenshot of Windows 3.1 desktop showing colour
settings (on "Plasma Power Saver"), Program Manager, a 50-row MS-DOS
prompt, Solitaire and Minesweeper]

This True-Colour Full HD screenshot, with large fonts, shows the staples
of the Windows 3.1 GUI and the iconic games Minesweeper and Solitaire.
The windowed 50-row DOS prompt demonstrates that I am running this on
MS-DOS 6.20, and that I'm using a real AMD graphics card with vendor
string equal to (C) 1988-2018, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and product
name equal to NAVI14.

Using third-party Calmira XP shell

[True-Colour Full HD screenshot of Calmira XP shell, with a photographic
wallpaper, showing colour settings (on "Bordeaux"), Character Map,
Advanced Task Manager, two MS-DOS prompts (one showing the main menu of
Rayman, the other showing VIDMODES.COM output), and Calmira Explorer]

This screenshot showcases the True Colour rendering capability, in the
wallpaper (a photo I took here) and in the Windows-XP-derived icons used
by the Calmira XP shell. The Advanced Task Manager instance again
confirms that we're on DOS 6.20 and Windows 3.10. It also says we're on
a 486, which of course isn't true, but that's just the newest CPU that
Windows 3.1 knows about! The 25-row DOS prompt shows the output of
VIDMODES.COM (see below), confirming again that I'm using a real AMD
graphics card with vendor string equal to
(C) 1988-2018, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and product name equal to
NAVI14 (reported a bit more legibly this time!). And what's that in the
other DOS prompt? That's right, it's Rayman (1995)! Thanks to the new
256-colour-capable grabber (see below), Rayman can now be played in a
window - it's a bit choppy, but it works!

Usage Notes

Hardware Support

In theory, this suite of drivers should support any graphics card that
properly supports the VESA BIOS Extensions, and doesn't do anything
funky with the memory window size. So basically, any hardware made in
the last thirty years. Unfortunately, real life is rarely as simple as
one would like, so there is some hardware that has some issues:

- The NVIDIA GeForce 1050 GTX has some issues with windowed DOS prompts,
  and presumably newer NVIDIA hardware has the same problem. The issues
  include potential freezes when using the mode command to change the
  size of the prompt, and font corruption when switching to full screen
  (which also affects blue screens).
- Intel 810 chipset integrated graphics crashes back to DOS during boot
  leaving you with a blank screen. It turns out there is an official
  driver for this chipset, so please use that instead:
  https://archive.org/details/w-810-r-209
- The AMD Radeon RX 7800 XT (and presumably newer Radeons) fails to boot
  in Enhanced Mode. The RX 5000 series is OK (that's what I develop on),
  and I don't know what the story is with the RX 6000 series.

In general, if your hardware is old enough, it probably has an official
driver for Windows 3.1 (like the i810). Official drivers should be
preferred where available because they generally use hardware
acceleration and don't use inefficient Real-Mode BIOS calls. On
processors from that era (especially early on), the CPU-bound routines
of VBESVGA.DRV tend to give really poor performance!

Integrity Verification

From v0.9.4, the releases ship with SHA1 sums for integrity
verification, to ensure corrupt driver files or helper programs don't
cause weird crashes or instability.

To make sure the files aren't corrupt, ensure everything is in one
folder and use the MD5SUM utility from FreeDOS, as follows:

    md5sum/m:sha/v/c VBESVGA.SHA

If any file from the release archive is corrupt, it will come up as
"FAILED".

Setup / Configuration Procedure

There are a few different ways to setup and configure the driver,
according to your tastes and requirements. In all cases, the first step
is to extract the vbesvga-release.zip archive to a folder on your
DOS/Win3.1 machine, or else mount the vbesvga.img as a floppy image (or
put it on a real floppy).

Generic OEMSETUP.INF

The OEMSETUP.INF file provided in the release archives and images, which
can be used with the Windows Setup tool, includes some basic profiles,
typical of early SVGA hardware. You can choose a resolution of 640*480,
800*600, 1024*768, or "Automatic", meaning that your monitor's preferred
resolution is auto-detected (which falls back to 1024*768 on failure).
For each choice of resolution, you can pick 256 (8-bit), 32k (15-bit),
65k (16-bit) or 16M (24-bit) colours, and Large (120-dpi) or Small
(96-dpi) fonts.

There is no guarantee that your system will support all of these modes,
so you may wish to use one of the other setup methods to get a more
customized configuration.

Thanks to @jschwartzenberg, @corma16 and @albertus82 for their help with
creating this file!

Interactive SETUP.EXE

Also included in the release archives and images is the SETUP.EXE tool,
which is an interactive DOS program. Simply run it, and it will present
a configuration interface and copy the required files into your Windows
folder. You can use it to select any display mode supported by your
hardware, and choose Large or Small fonts. Unlike the OEMSETUP.INF, you
can also configure the SwapBuffersInterval and BounceOnModeset values
documented below.

Once it installs the driver, it also creates a VBESVGA.EXE DOS program
in the Windows directory that you can use to reconfigure the driver
without reinstalling.

Thanks to @joshudson for creating this tool!

Generating a bespoke OEMSETUP.INF

You can also use @albertus82's BASIC script to generate a bespoke
OEMSETUP.INF for your machine, and then install the driver using Windows
Setup.

Using the driver with DBCS versions of Windows / DOS (e.g. Japanese)

Currently, VDDVBE.386 only supports standard text mode for "message
mode" (better known as BSoDs). To boot it on a DBCS version of DOS, you
will need to use the shim driver VDDD.386, found in the Japanese version
of Windows 3.1. This problem probably only arises with DBCS versions of
Win9x, which normally support graphical-mode BSoDs, but (for now) cannot
do so with this driver.

See also issue #98.

Full list of configuration options

All of these options are recognized in the [VBESVGA.DRV] section of
SYSTEM.INI. You can edit them manually, but the most important ones can
be set using the SETUP.EXE / VBESVGA.EXE tool described above.

Using debug builds

To use the debug builds, you can place the VDDVBE.386, VBEVMDIB.3GR
and/or VBESVGA.DRV files from the vbesvga-debug.zip archive (or the
debug folder in the vbesvga.img floppy image) in your SYSTEM directory,
replacing the ones installed from vbesvga-release.zip (or the root
directory of vbesvga.img). The corresponding SYM files can be used with
WDEB386 (supplied with the Win16 DDK) or the Open Watcom debugger (only
if the SYMs are placed in the SYSTEM directory).

To make the aforementioned debugger WDEB386.EXE work on anything newer
than a 486, you need to change some bytes:

- At position 63D8, you need to change 0F 24 F0 to 66 33 C0
- At position 63DF, you need to change 0F 24 F8 to 66 33 C0

This removes references to the TR6 and TR7 registers, which crash the
system since they only existed on the 386, 486 and a few other
less-well-known chips!

Limitations in Windows programs / components

Program Manager icons

When using high-colour modes, Program Manager may complain that there is
not enough memory to convert all the icons. There is nothing I can do
about this, as it is a limitation of Program Manager itself, as
described in this VOGONS post. It tries to stuff all the 32*32 icon
bitmaps for each program group into a single 64k segment, so the max
icons you can have per group is floor(65535 / (32 * 32 * (Total bit
depth / 8))). That's 31 for 16-bit modes, 21 for 24-bit modes (not
accessible with Allow3ByteMode=0) and 15 for 32-bit modes. (This
limitation doesn't come into play for 8-bit modes, because there is a
hard limit of 50 icons anyway, regardless of bitmap sizes.)

MS-DOS Prompt crashing the system in Standard Mode

On newer graphics cards, when you try to open an MS-DOS prompt in
Standard Mode (not 386 Enhanced Mode), the screen may start flashing
with various garbage characters appearing in quick succession, and only
a reboot will fix it. This happens regardless of whether or not you use
this driver. This is caused by a stack overflow in the logo code in
WIN.COM when it tries to do an int 10h call.

To work around this issue, you can try using the AUXSTACK.COM TSR,
included in newer releases. Simply run AUXSTACK.COM before starting
Windows, and it will allocate 1 kiB of Conventional Memory to use as an
auxiliary stack and prevent the overflow from occurring. You can use the
tool AUXCHECK.COM to see if this is needed rather than using trial and
error[1].

Please note that, contrary to speculation in earlier versions of this
document, this tool cannot prevent boot failures! The stack used during
Windows boot is much larger than when Standard Mode starts a DOS prompt,
so this issue doesn't apply in that situation.

Zoom-in in Paintbrush

The zoomed-in editing mode in Paintbrush breaks in high-colour mode if
the viewport is wider than about 800 pixels (100 zoomed-in pixels). You
can work around this issue by reducing the size of the window while
working in this mode. The reason is that this driver doesn't implement
StretchBlt, and so GDI falls back to its internal implementation, which
limits the intermediate DIB size to (again) a 64k segment (more details
here). Because it uses a DIB, the outcome is the same regardless of
whether you use a 16-bit, 24-bit or 32-bit video mode.

Note that this limitation doesn't apply in Windows 9x when using Paint,
because in Windows 95's version of GDI.EXE, the intermediate DIB size
limit was increased to three segments (i.e. 192 kiB) for high-colour
stretching.

Viewing large photographs

The largest bitmap that can be allocated in Windows 3.1 is 0FF0000h,
i.e. about 16.7 million bytes, which is a limitation of KRNL386.EXE.
This means that the largest photographs that can be viewed are 16.6 MP
in 8-bit mode, 8.3 MP in 16-bit mode, ~5 MP in 24-bit mode and ~4 MP in
32-bit mode, or possibly slightly less depending on how the scanlines
line up with segment boundaries. I guess this isn't a very common
usecase anyway, but I felt I should point it out since there's nothing
that can be done about it in this driver. (Despite the fact that ACDSee
claims that the "display driver" couldn't create the bitmap in such
situations!)

On a somewhat related note, it is also possible to get General
Protection Faults when trying to open large-ish bitmaps, e.g. for
wallpapers over 1024*768, if you have PageOverCommit=1 set in the
[386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI. Apparently QEMM setup for Windows can
quietly add this setting, resulting in these kinds of problems. Removing
this directive will allow you to view larger bitmaps up to the
16.7-million-byte limit without problems.

Mode selection

When Windows boots, the driver queries the BIOS for available modes, and
evaluates each one which fulfills the following criteria:

- Supported by the current hardware according to the BIOS
- Graphics mode (not text)
- Colour mode (not black & white)
- Total bit depth (i.e. red+green+blue+padding) is exactly 1, 2, 3
  (unless Allow3ByteMode=0) or 4 bytes
- Either packed-pixel or direct-colour framebuffer

Each mode which fulfills these criteria is assigned a "score",
indicating how well it matches the desired resolution and depth
specified in SYSTEM.INI. The score is the sum of four components:

- Absolute difference of width (in pixels) from the SYSTEM.INI spec (or,
  by default, your monitor's preferred width, or 1024)
- Absolute difference of height (in scanlines) from the SYSTEM.INI spec
  (or, by default, your monitor's preferred height, or 768)
- Absolute difference of significant depth (in bits) from the SYSTEM.INI
  spec (or, by default, 24)
- +1 if you asked for a linear mode (i.e. if PreferBankedModes=0) but it
  can only work with bank switching, or vice versa (see below for more
  details)

If it doesn't find a perfect match among your system's VBE modes, the
driver also checks mode 13h, which is the standard 320*200*8 VGA mode.
Depending on your configuration options, this may or may not turn out to
be the best-scoring mode.

If you know what resolution your monitor and card support, then set the
Width and Height accordingly (or allow them to be autodetected). Note
that this automatic search and scoring system is the only way the driver
selects modes: you cannot give it a specific VESA mode number to use.

If you're not sure which resolution to try, the VIDMODES.COM tool
included in the releases can list the available modes on your system to
give some idea. Example output running under DOSBox-X 2024.07.01[2]:

    Perfect usable match for default mode 1024*768*24: 0118
    VBESVGA.DRV will attempt to boot in that mode.

    To check another mode, use /w, /h and /d switches
    to specify desired width / height / depth - e.g.:
        vidmodes/w800/h600/d16

    VIDMODES.COM from Git commit ab3f0fc
    Total modes found: 53

Another example can be seen in the screenshot above, running on real
hardware.

You can see that it lists all detected colour graphics modes, showing
their resolutions in typical Width*Height*NominalBitDepth form. It then
indicates the memory model for each one - only packed-pixel and
direct-colour modes are usable with VBESVGA.DRV, so all others say "NG"
(no good).

Direct-colour modes may have padding bits in each pixel, so the bit
depths for these modes are listed with and without padding. The "S"
number is what I call the significant depth, which excludes padding
bits, and the "T" number is the total depth, which is the physical size
of a pixel in memory. The driver searches for modes whose significant
depths match what is specified in SYSTEM.INI (or 24 by default), but
also makes sure the total depth is divisible by eight. If it is not
divisible by eight, then pixels are not byte-aligned, and so those modes
are also "NG" as seen above.

For modes which pass these checks, VIDMODES.COM also prints out linOK if
they can be used as linear modes. This is followed by the location, size
and granularity of the VRAM window, if they can be used as bank-switched
modes. In all the cases I've seen so far, the size has always been 64k,
while the granularity can sometimes be smaller. If the size is over 64k,
or not an integer multiple of the granularity, or less than 64k and not
an integer multiple of the scanline width, then VBESVGA.DRV cannot
bank-switch the mode, and VIDMODES.COM will briefly explain why. Such
modes can still be used as linear modes, if they support it. These
conditions may sound quite complicated, but I would be very surprised if
there turned out to be real hardware that violates them!

You can also use VIDMODES.COM as part of a batch file to check whether
or not VBESVGA.DRV can be expected to boot with certain mode settings.
An example usage is given at the end of the output above. The errorlevel
is set to: * 0 (success) if a perfect match is found * 1 if a
corresponding mode is not found, but VBESVGA.DRV will attempt to boot
with the closest match * 2 if your graphics card doesn't support VBE at
all, in which case VBESVGA.DRV will attempt to boot in mode 13h, i.e.
320*200*8

Linear Modes and Double Buffering

The VBE modes used by this driver involve a framebuffer larger than can
be addressed by a single segment (65536 bytes). VBE provides two
strategies for dealing with this: bank-switching and using linear
framebuffers. Bank-switching involves mapping only one segment at a time
into physical memory, usually at address A0000h, whereas a linear
framebuffer gets fully mapped somewhere in extended memory (i.e. beyond
the 1-MiB boundary).

Up to version 0.9.1 inclusive, it was not possible to use linear modes
when Windows was running in Standard Mode with a memory manager such as
EMM386. However, newer versions include a workaround for this bug in
DOSX.EXE, meaning that this is no longer the case! This should make it
easier to use linear modes if your computer can't run 386 Enhanced Mode
for whatever reason. The best part is that the fix installed by this
driver can also be used by any other drivers you load &ndash; for
example, the HD Audio driver, which normally has the same limitation!

When using a linear framebuffer, on a 386 or newer, the driver also
attempts to use Double Buffering, which improves performance by ensuring
that GDI operations never have to touch video RAM directly. However, it
involves allocating two copies of the framebuffer in system RAM, which
is quite expensive (especially given that Windows 3.1 usually can't take
advantage of more than a quarter of a GiB). If it can't allocate this
much RAM, it falls back to direct VRAM access.

Basically, if you have a modern graphics card and a decent amount of
system RAM, then the driver will probably enable Double Buffering. In
that case, you can adjust how often the screen is redrawn using the
SwapBuffersInterval= setting in SYSTEM.INI. The default is 16 ms, which
means that the screen is redrawn just over sixty times a second.
Unfortunately I haven't found a way to synchronize it to your monitor's
blanking interval, meaning that "sixty times a second" and "60fps" won't
necessarily line up as well as one might hope (see discussion here).
Shorter intervals lead to smoother drawing - as long as your CPU can
keep up!

If you suspect there are problems with Double Buffering, you can
force-disable it by setting SwapBuffersInterval=0. This can
significantly degrade performance for certain operations on large
screens, but may be useful for debugging...

Note that the DCI Provider (which is a minimum implementation), used by
Video for Windows and certain games, only works in linear modes. The VxD
DVA.386 (or VFLATD on Win9x) does provide a mechanism to make a
bank-switched framebuffer look like a linear one for DCI, but this only
works when the driver provides a snippet of 32-bit code to switch the
bank. VBESVGA.DRV is not in a position to do this, since it does bank
switching by calling out to a 16-bit function provided by the Video
BIOS.

Running DOS programs / games in windowed mode

As you probably know, in 386 Enhanced Mode, Windows 3.1 allows running
DOS sessions in a window. With this driver, VDDVBE.386 and VBEVMDIB.3GR
are responsible for video memory management and rendering, respectively,
of these windowed sessions. These two modules have certain features and
limitations you should be aware of when using this functionality.

Text mode sessions

Firstly, when starting up a windowed DOS session, the screen will most
likely flash momentarily. This is because when a DOS session starts up,
it does a mode-set to mode 3 (standard CGA/EGA/VGA text mode). This
mode-set does some port I/O to reprogram a bunch of CGA/EGA/VGA
registers, which gets trapped by VDDVBE.386, and used to update the
state of the associated DOS VM. However, on modern graphics cards, this
usually does some further I/O to reprogram vendor-specific registers,
which VDDVBE.386 knows nothing about. Since this I/O does not get
trapped, it tends to leave the display in some corrupt hybrid mode
(example). To prevent this, whenever a windowed DOS VM does any kind of
mode-set, VDDVBE.386 immediately instructs VBESVGA.DRV to reset the mode
and re-draw the display. This tends to flash the screen, but it's vastly
preferable to the alternative!

Beyond that, text-mode DOS windows work as you would expect, and there
aren't any major gotchas or foibles.

Graphical mode sessions

The CGA graphical modes (320*200, 4-colour, and 640*200, 2-colour) are
also fully usable in windowed DOS sessions. They are upscaled to
640*400, as one would expect.

Unfortunately, when it comes to EGA and VGA modes, things get a lot
hairier. As outlined here, the EGA and VGA had multiple memory planes
(three and four respectively), which could be addressed, read from, and
written to, in all kinds of weird and wonderful ways. Virtualizing these
memory planes efficiently is far beyond the capabilities of the 386's
MMU, or anything descended from it[3], so Windows 3.1's Virtual Display
Driver (VDD) took a different approach. It would look for off-screen
pages of Video RAM and assign them to DOS VMs on an as-needed basis, so
that the running DOS programs could interface directly with the EGA/VGA
hardware and do all the interesting read/write magic. The contents of
the planes would then be read by the VDD and passed to the grabber to
render in the DOS session's window.

Unfortunately, there are a couple of problems with this approach on
modern hardware. First of all, there's the concept of an off-screen page
of VRAM. While modern graphics cards do of course have orders of
magnitude more VRAM than is needed to display a single frame on the
screen, assigning an off-screen page to a DOS VM is easier said than
done. The simplest way might be to grab the first page beyond the end of
the framebuffer, which will typically have an offset considerably larger
than the 256 kiB VRAM size of the original VGA. We could use bank
switching to map it somewhere in the physical range A0000h-B0000h, but
then would that be guaranteed to work if Windows is running in a linear
mode? Allocating a page from the linear framebuffer itself would have a
very low chance of success, since most (if not all) hardware would map
that buffer in a way that bypasses all the EGA/VGA-style addressing
mechanisms.

A more promising approach would be to allocate the first 256 kiB of VRAM
for this, and have the graphics card render the display starting from
that offset. VBE does in fact provide a function for this, but it turns
out that newer hardware doesn't bother to implement that function. In
fact, it doesn't even give any indication that the function's not
implemented, so I can't even detect it at runtime. So basically, that
approach is off-limits too, since I want this driver to work well on
even the newest hardware.

Secondly, even if I could reliably find an off-screen VRAM page and map
it somewhere in the physical A0000h-B0000h range, while Windows is in a
VBE mode, there would still be no guarantee that the graphics card would
let me treat it like EGA/VGA RAM. There's probably a line in some spec
somewhere that says it should, but my experience of working on this
tells me that modern graphics cards pay very little attention to what
they "should" be doing for legacy support once they're in a
high-resolution VBE mode!

So, unfortunately, there is no way to run DOS programs in a planar
EGA/VGA mode inside a window while using this driver. Using VBEVMDIB.3GR
will ensure that any DOS sessions that try to use one of these modes get
forced into fullscreen (although there might be some display corruption
when this happens).

There is a silver lining, however: one of the modes introduced by the
VGA doesn't require any of this planar trickery. Mode 13h, aka 320*200
256-colour, presents a linear 64,000-byte framebuffer at address A0000h,
which can easily be replaced by virtual memory, just like the
framebuffers used in the CGA modes. The grabber that came with Windows
3.1 didn't support this mode (possibly because Windows itself only ran
in 16 colours out of the box), but VBEVMDIB.3GR does! This means you can
run 256-colour games in a window while using this driver, as long as
they don't put the VGA back in planar mode (which quite a few games
did - oh well...). You can see Rayman (1995) running successfully in
mode 13h in the screenshot above, and its default "PCI1" video mode
doesn't use planar mode at all, so it is playable!

Long story short, you can window graphical programs that run in CGA
modes, or 256-colour VGA mode, but unfortunately not planar EGA/VGA
modes.

Frame-rate regulation for windowed DOS sessions

A lot of DOS games poll the "input status 1" register to determine when
the display is in vertical retrace, and use this to regulate the
rendering frame-rate. When running in a window, this register is
virtualized by the Virtual Display Driver, in this case VDDVBE.386.
Microsoft wrote an algorithm where the register would appear as "not in
vertical retrace" 255 times, then "in vertical retrace" 12 times, no
matter what the time interval was between the polls. In fact, they got
it a bit mixed up - it would appear "in vertical retrace" every second
poll of the first 255... Anyway, that may have worked to delay display
refreshes on a 386, but it won't cut the mustard on modern CPUs that are
orders of magnitude faster!

Because of this, VDDVBE.386 can use timer events to simulate the
vertical retrace timing (slightly) more accurately, using a period
calculated based on the timing programmed by the DOS program / game into
the CRTC registers. This function only activates if the user's config
suggests that the CPU can handle it. That is to say, these timer events
are only used if the period is no shorter than either
SwapBuffersInterval (documented above) or the WindowUpdateTime setting
in the [386Enh] section of SYSTEM.INI[4].

For example, if you have a game in a window that wants to run at 60fps
(16 ms per frame), your SwapBuffersInterval is 16 ms (the default) and
your WindowUpdateTime is 50 ms (also the default), then timer events
will be used to simulate the vertical retrace period accurately.
However, if the game wants to run at 70fps (14 ms per frame), timer
events will not be used, and VDDVBE.386 will fall back to the old 255/12
algorithm. To make it use timer events, you would have to reduce the
SwapBuffersInterval and/or WindowUpdateTime to at most 14.

Generally, if you plan to run DOS games windowed, it's a good idea to
set both SwapBuffersInterval and WindowUpdateTime as short as possible
(without saturating the CPU).

The vertical retrace IRQ

The EGA introduced an optional interrupt signal associated with the
vertical retrace, on IRQ2. Unfortunately, hardware implementation of
this over the years has been patchy at best. I decided to virtualize
this for windowed DOS sessions (since I had gone to the trouble of
setting up timer events anyway). So if you have a DOS game that wants to
use IRQ2 to signal the next frame, you can try running it in a window,
with an appropriately short SwapBuffersInterval and WindowUpdateTime!

Unfortunately, the practical uses for this are probably nil, since the
most reliable implementation of this IRQ was on the original EGA, and
any games built for that are likely to use one of the EGA display modes,
which (as explained above) can't be windowed. Oh well!

Build Process

Thanks to @lss4 for pointing out some omissions in the setup process!

Note that the only step below which requires Windows is the initial
installation of Visual C++ - the build process itself is purely
DOS-based and can be automated using a batch file. See the file
release-work/make-release.sh for an example of how this can be done
using DOSBox on Linux.

vbesvga.drv (needed in both Standard and 386 Enhanced Mode)

- Install both the Win16 DDK and a contemporary version of Visual C++
- Obtain a copy of EXE2BIN.EXE (e.g. from FreeDOS, or from the Open
  Watcom compiler) and place it somewhere in your PATH
- Place the VBESVGA folder from this repository in the DDK hierarchy, at
  286/DISPLAY/8PLANE/VBESVGA
- Ensure MSVCVARS.BAT from Visual C++ has been run to setup the
  environment
- In addition, ensure 286\TOOLS from the DDK is in your PATH and 286\INC
  is in your INCLUDE variable
- Go to the VBESVGA\mak folder and run make vbesvga.mak; this should
  create the file VBESVGA.DRV which can be loaded by Windows

vddvbe.386 (needed only in 386 Enhanced Mode)

  VBEVMDIB.3GR which can be loaded by Windows

TODO list

Things that should probably done before v1.0.0

- Figure out some kind of versioning scheme within the code, ideally
  integrated with Git (because I'm forgetful!), so user can easily
  figure out which version of the driver they're installing / running
- Make sure the driver works just as well on Win9x as it does on Win3.1
- Consider adding a paper-thin implementation of StretchBlt to overcome
  the "zoom-in in Paintbrush" limitation above (basically it would punt
  straight to GDI for smaller scanline widths, and then for wider ones
  allocate its own DIB and call out to GDI's StretchDIBits function)
- Investigate adding support for colour / animated cursors, for Win9x
- Investigate adding proper support for graphical-mode BSoDs, for DBCS
  versions of Win9x

Things that might come later

- Consider efficiency improvements in swap_buffers and/or
  VDD_SwapBuffers, to reduce idle CPU usage
- Consider adding a virtual RAMDAC to the double-buffering code in
  VDDVBE.386 to allow standard 256-colour modes to be emulated on
  hardware that only supports high-colour VBE modes
- See if VDDVBE.386 can work on newer AMD hardware (I don't have any
  affected hardware)
- Investigate adding Windows 3.0 support (perhaps still requiring a 286,
  i.e. refusing to boot on anything older)
- Investigate using VBE/AF where available for 2D acceleration
- Investigate adding Windows 1/2 support

[1] Ideally this check would be built into the Windows boot process in
the driver, but unfortunately this is basically impossible, since
KRNL386.EXE appropriates all Conventional Memory during the boot
process, and then this gets evicted when you start an MS-DOS Prompt in
Standard Mode. So there's really no way to start a TSR from inside
Windows that will actually stay resident when you attempt to start a DOS
prompt.

[2] In the specific case of DOSBox-X, this list can actually be modified
using the VESAMOED command, which is documented here - thanks to
@blue-devil-93 for pointing this out! More generally, however, this is
obviously not the case.

[3] Just try running a VGA-mode program under QEMU with hardware
virtualization enabled - drawing the display can take several seconds!

[4] This setting, also in milliseconds, defines how quickly the display
can update in a DOS session window. It is not specific to this driver,
but I only found out about it recently, so I thought I should mention it
here!
